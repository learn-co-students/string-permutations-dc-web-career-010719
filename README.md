## Depth First Search Lab!

### Objectives

 * Implement Depth First Search in Javascript.

### Instructions

```javascript
let edges = [
	['14th&6th', '23rd&6th'],
	['23rd&6th', '34th&6th'],
	['34th&6th', '28th&Bwy'],
	['28th&Bwy', '23rd&Bwy'],
	['23rd&Bwy', '14th&Lex'],
	['14th&Lex', '23rd&Lex']
]

let vertices = [
  {name: '34th&6th', discovered: null},
  {name: '23rd&6th', discovered: null},
  {name: '14th&6th', discovered: null},
  {name: '28th&Bwy', discovered: null},
	{name: '23rd&Bwy', discovered: null},
  {name: '14th&Lex', discovered: null},
	{name: '23rd&Lex', discovered: null}
]

```

In this lab we ask you to implement depth first search.  One skill that we would like you to develop is the ability to take an idea and translate it into code.  So here is some pseudocode of depth first search from Wikipedia.  

Your task is to translate this into code.  The only modification, is that each time a vertex is visited, please push that vertex into an array of visited vertices, and return that array when the function completes.
